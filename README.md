This is a basic flashcard app I created during the Treehouse Techdegree program to learn Node.js, NPM, Express, and Pug. I started the project using Node.js and Express to create the routing for the site. In tandem with creating the routing for the site, I utilized Pug to effectively reuse HTML and render it across the different pages. After completing the work on the skeleton for the whole app, I set up a static server for the CSS file that was provided and modified the Pug accordingly to make sure the CSS rendered properly.
